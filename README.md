This project contains a implementation of the LA-N algorithm for approximating BRP solutions given by Petering et. al. in "A new mixed integer program and extended look-ahead heuristic
algorithm for the block relocation problem" (2013).

It is intented primarily for comparing the LA-N algorithms for varying Ns. 
The algorithm is not optimized in terms of run time.

Use [`rspec`](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec) to execute the test suite. You can also find basic examples in the `spec` directory.
